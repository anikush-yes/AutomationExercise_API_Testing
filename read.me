*AutomationExercise API Testing

Overview

This project contains API test cases for AutomationExercise using Postman and Newman. The tests cover various functionalities such as retrieving product lists, searching for products, handling user authentication, and managing user accounts.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Install Postman

Install Newman for CLI testing

Ensure API base URL is set correctly in Postman environment variables

Installation

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AutomationExercise_API_Testing.git

Navigate to the project folder:

cd AutomationExercise_API_Testing

Install dependencies (if required for Newman execution):

npm install -g newman

API Endpoints Tested

1. Products

GET /productsList - Retrieve all products

POST /productsList - Verify invalid request handling

2. Brands

GET /brandsList - Retrieve all brands

PUT /brandsList - Verify method not supported

3. Search

POST /searchProduct - Search for products

POST /searchProduct (without parameter) - Verify bad request handling

4. User Authentication

POST /verifyLogin - Verify login with valid credentials

POST /verifyLogin (without email) - Verify error handling

POST /verifyLogin (invalid details) - Check invalid login attempt

DELETE /verifyLogin - Verify unsupported method handling

5. User Account Management

POST /createAccount - Create a new user

PUT /updateAccount - Update user details

GET /getUserDetailByEmail - Retrieve user details

DELETE /deleteAccount - Delete user account

6. Negative Path Testing

Invalid product search

Account creation without required fields

Retrieving non-existent user account

Tests Included

Status Code Validation: Ensures correct HTTP response codes are returned.

Response Time Check: Confirms API responses are within acceptable time limits.

JSON Schema Validation: Verifies API responses match expected structures.

Functional Testing: Ensures API operations work as expected.

Error Handling Tests: Tests invalid requests and verifies proper error messages.

GET /productsList

Request:

GET /productsList HTTP/1.1
Host: {{base_url}}

{
  "responseCode": 200,
  "products": [

    }
  ]
}

Running the Tests

Using Postman

Import the AutomationExercise_API_Testing.postman_collection.json into Postman.

Set the base_url environment variable.

Run the collection manually.

Using Newman (CLI)

To run the tests from the command line:

newman run AutomationExercise_API_Testing.postman_collection.json --reporters cli

Expected Results

All valid requests should return 200 OK.

Invalid requests should return proper error messages (400/404/405).

API response times should be under 1000ms.

Notes

Ensure the API base URL is correctly set before running the tests.

Some tests rely on valid user credentials, update them as needed.
